# Contributing

The purpose of this repository is to use it as practice for making contributions to a repository that you do not have write access to.
Our contribution guidelines reflect this.

All contributions should come from a fork whether the contributor has direct write access to the repository or not.
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue.
Feel free to make your changes after filing an issue, no need to wait for a comment or response.
If your change creates a new file, please place the new file in the "practice" directory.

Once you are satisfied with your changes, please open a Pull Request and request review from the repository maintainer.
You may merge the Pull Request in once you have received approval, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.

For more information about how contributions are recognized at Arcadia Science, please see our [guide on feedback, contributions, and reuse](https://github.com/Arcadia-Science/arcadia-software-handbook/blob/main/guides-and-standards/guide-credit-for-contributions.md).
